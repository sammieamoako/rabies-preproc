#######PREPROCESSING

  The preprocessing of fMRI images was conducted using the open-source RABIES software (https://github.com/CoBrALab/RABIES)[1]. A volumetric EPI image was derived using a trimmed mean across the EPI frames, after an initial motion realignment step. Using this volumetric EPI as a target, the head motion parameters are estimated by realigning each EPI frame to the target using a rigid registration. To derive an alignment to common space, structural images are initially corrected for inhomogeneities and then registered together to allow the alignment of different acquisition sessions. This is done by generating an unbiased data-driven template through the iterative nonlinear registration of each image to a dataset average, where the average is improved at each iteration (https://github.com/CoBrALab/optimized_antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction) [2]. After aligning the acquisition sessions, this newly-generated unbiased template is then itself registered, using a nonlinear registration, to an external reference atlas.To correct for EPI susceptibility distortions, the volumetric EPI is also subjected to inhomogeneity correction, and then registered using a nonlinear registration to the anatomical scan from the same MRI session, which allows to calculate the required geometrical transforms for recovering brain anatomy [3]. Finally, after calculating the transformations required to correct for head motion and susceptibility distortions, transforms were concatenated into a single resampling operation (avoiding multiple resampling) which is applied at each EPI frame, generating the preprocessed EPI timeseries in native space [4]. Preprocessed timeseries in common space are also generated by further concatenating the transforms allowing resampling to the reference atlas.
